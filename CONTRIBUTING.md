## Issue Reporting Guidelines


## Pull Request Guidelines
- The `master` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**
- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `dev`, and merge back against that branch.
- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.
- If adding new feature:
  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.
- If fixing a bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.
- Please, before creating the pull request, be sure to follow the ROS best practices and formats described in the following resources:
    - [ROS Best practices](http://wiki.ros.org/BestPractices)
    - [ROS Developers Guide](http://wiki.ros.org/DevelopersGuide)
    - [ROS Cpp Style Guide](http://wiki.ros.org/CppStyleGuide), there is also a `.clang-format` file to help with styling.

    - and many more in the ROS website.
